- 🔲 Sitemap generation
- 🔲 GA4 integration
- 🔲 OG images for content
- 🔲 Final polish pass
- 🔲 Mobile device testing

## 📝 Notes

### Known Issues
- One intentional warning: `ArcadeCard` has unused `description` prop (reserved for future use)
- 404 for `/demos/neural-network-visualizer` during build (expected, seed content)

### Design Decisions
- Cassette theme chosen for music player (over vinyl/iPod)
- 300ms threshold for loader (prevents flicker on fast transitions)
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Reduced-motion as first-class citizen
- Event bus for music player coordination

### Performance Targets
- ✅ <100KB JS on mobile
- ✅ <20KB CSS on mobile
- ⏳ LCP <2.5s (needs testing)
- ⏳ FID <100ms (needs testing)
- ⏳ CLS <0.1 (needs testing)
