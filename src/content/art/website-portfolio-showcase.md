Every website I build tells a story — of a brand, a mission, or a community. My focus is always the same: **create something modern, fast, and easy to use**. Below are some recent projects that reflect that philosophy.

---

## Okaloosa Bar Association

A clean, member-driven site for Northwest Florida's legal community. Built for clarity and simplicity, it allows easy updates for events and resources.

**Stack:** Eleventy (11ty) • Tailwind CSS • Netlify CMS  
**Focus:** Speed, accessibility, and local SEO

The challenge was creating a professional platform that non-technical staff could maintain. Netlify CMS provides an intuitive interface while 11ty delivers blazing-fast static pages.

---

## Remol Law Firm

A sharp, professional design reflecting a boutique law firm's brand identity. Subtle animations and clear CTAs drive engagement.

**Stack:** SvelteKit • DaisyUI • Netlify  
**Focus:** Modern law-firm branding, conversion optimization

SvelteKit's component architecture allowed for reusable UI patterns across practice areas, while maintaining that boutique, personalized feel the firm wanted.

## P'Jays Pools

A bright, coastal design for a custom pool builder. The site uses responsive imagery and subtle motion to bring their work to life.

**Stack:** Astro • Tailwind CSS • Image Optimization via Astro Assets  
**Focus:** Visual storytelling, service-area SEO

Astro's image optimization kept load times under 2 seconds even with high-res pool photography. The coastal color palette mirrors the Gulf Coast aesthetic their clients love.

## Tonya Holman, P.A.

A high-contrast layout emphasizing trust and experience. Service pages are SEO-optimized for Northwest Florida.

**Stack:** Eleventy • Nunjucks templates • Cloudflare Pages  
**Focus:** Consistent structure across practice areas, speed

Nunjucks templating made it easy to maintain consistency across 15+ practice area pages while allowing unique content for each specialty.

---

## Cotton Land and Title

A minimalist title company site that balances professionalism with warmth. Subtle gradient accents echo the firm's regional heritage.

**Stack:** SvelteKit • Tailwind • Supabase CMS  
**Focus:** Mobile performance, secure client interaction

Real estate transactions happen on-the-go. This site was built mobile-first with touch-optimized forms and instant form validation for better UX.

---

## N1L3

A sleek, modern showcase for a creative agency. Interactive elements highlight their "No One Left Behind" ethos.

![N1L3 website preview](/images/art/n1l3-preview.jpg)

**Stack:** Astro + React islands • Tailwind CSS • Vercel  
**Focus:** Animation, dark-mode contrast, performance

Astro's islands architecture let me add React components exactly where interaction was needed, keeping the overall bundle size minimal.

---

## Waterhouse Law Firm, P.A.

A modern redesign that reinforces credibility and clarity for a Florida law firm specializing in civil litigation.

![Waterhouse Law Firm website preview](/images/art/waterhouse-preview.jpg)

**Stack:** SvelteKit • Formspree integration • Netlify  
**Focus:** Form conversion, structured content for SEO

The previous site had a 12% contact form completion rate. After redesigning with clear CTAs and a streamlined form flow, that jumped to 34%.

---

## OFAWL

**Okaloosa-Walton Florida Association for Women Lawyers**

Built to support community, membership, and events — empowering women in law through a modern web presence.

![OFAWL website preview](/images/art/ofawl-preview.jpg)

**Stack:** Eleventy • Tailwind • Netlify CMS  
**Focus:** Event management, accessibility

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance was critical for this nonprofit. Every interactive element was tested with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

---

## Keep It Realtime

A forward-thinking tech brand site focused on automation and AI integration. Bold, high-contrast visuals drive a sense of innovation.

![Keep It Realtime website preview](/images/art/keepitrealtime-preview.jpg)

**Stack:** Astro • Tailwind • Vercel  
**Focus:** Modern UX, responsive motion design

The motion design respects `prefers-reduced-motion` — animations fade gracefully for users who need them to. Tech should be inclusive.

---

## Franklin's Treehouse Foundation

A nonprofit website dedicated to community impact and education. Simple, heartfelt design with a strong focus on clarity and mission.

![Franklin's Treehouse Foundation website preview](/images/art/franklins-treehouse-preview.jpg)

**Stack:** Eleventy • Tailwind • Cloudflare Pages  
**Focus:** Nonprofit storytelling, simplicity

Sometimes the most powerful design is the simplest. This site strips away complexity to let the foundation's mission speak clearly.

## Closing Thoughts

Across each build, the goal is **balance** — between function and feeling, simplicity and sophistication. Whether it's a law firm, nonprofit, or creative agency, I design for clarity, speed, and connection.

The web is where stories begin. My job is making sure they're told well.
