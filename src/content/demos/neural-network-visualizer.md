## What This Does

Ever wondered how neural networks actually learn? This interactive demo lets you watch the learning process in real-time.

You'll see:
- **Input layer** receiving handwritten digits
- **Hidden layers** processing patterns
- **Output layer** making predictions
- **Backpropagation** adjusting weights

No AI experience needed - just click, draw, and watch it learn!

## How to Use

1. Draw a digit (0-9) on the canvas
2. Watch the network predict what you drew
3. See how confident it is in each prediction
4. Train it on new examples to improve accuracy

## Technical Details

Built with TensorFlow.js for browser-based training. The network uses:
- 784 input neurons (28x28 pixel grid)
- 2 hidden layers (128 neurons each)
- 10 output neurons (digits 0-9)
- ReLU activation + softmax output

### Implementation Highlights

```javascript
const model = tf.sequential({
  layers: [
    tf.layers.dense({ units: 128, activation: 'relu', inputShape: [784] }),
    tf.layers.dense({ units: 128, activation: 'relu' }),
    tf.layers.dense({ units: 10, activation: 'softmax' })
  ]
});
```
