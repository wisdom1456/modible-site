# About Modible

Welcome to the arcade of modern technology.

## What is This?

Modible is an interactive exploration of AI, neural networks, and generative art - but styled like a 1990s arcade. Every project is a playable "demo" with CRT glow, scanlines, and cassette tape loaders.

## Why?

Because learning should feel like playing. Because modern tech doesn't have to be intimidating. Because we miss when the internet was weird and wonderful.

## The Philosophy

- **Retro is the hook, not the product** - The 90s aesthetic makes complex technology approachable
- **Learn through play** - Interactive demos beat boring textbooks
- **Plain English** - No jargon, no assumptions, just clear explanations
- **Beautiful & fast** - Nostalgic doesn't mean slow or ugly

## Built With

- SvelteKit for the framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MDsveX for content
- Love for retro computing
