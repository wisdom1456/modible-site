## Next Steps - Required

### 1. Add Images ðŸ“¸

You need to add the following images to `static/images/art/`:

#### Preview Images (1200x800px recommended)
- [ ] `okaloosabar-preview.jpg`
- [ ] `remol-law-preview.jpg`
- [ ] `pjays-pools-preview.jpg`
- [ ] `tonya-holman-preview.jpg`
- [ ] `cottonlandtitle-preview.jpg`
- [ ] `n1l3-preview.jpg`
- [ ] `waterhouse-preview.jpg`
- [ ] `ofawl-preview.jpg`
- [ ] `keepitrealtime-preview.jpg`
- [ ] `franklins-treehouse-preview.jpg`

#### Open Graph Image (1200x630px required)
- [ ] `website-portfolio-og.png` - For social media previews

**Image Optimization Tips:**
- Use WebP format for smaller file sizes
- Target < 200KB per image
- Run through TinyPNG or Squoosh.app
- Consider using screenshot tools with browser chrome for consistency

### 2. Review & Customize Content

1. Open `src/content/art/website-portfolio-showcase.md`
2. Review the content - it's been adapted to your retro aesthetic
3. Adjust any descriptions or details as needed
4. Verify website URLs and project details

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

Visit:
- `/art` - Gallery page with your portfolio post
- `/art/website-portfolio-showcase` - Full portfolio post

### 4. Deploy

Once images are added and you've reviewed the content:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add website portfolio showcase to gallery"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically deploy in 2-3 minutes.

## SEO Optimizations Applied

âœ… **Open Graph**: Configured for social media sharing (add image)  
âœ… **Canonical URLs**: Set for proper indexing
